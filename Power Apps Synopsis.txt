Power Apps sessions Basics:

There are two sessions planned for Power Apps:

a) Today
b) Next week 9 am IST

Agenda for Today:

1. What is Power Platform? 
2.What is Power Apps?
2.Need of Power Apps?
3. What kind of Services supported in Power Apps.
4. Embedding Power BI Report in Power Apps Tile
5. Sending an Email using Power Apps and Gmail from Microsoft Flow
6. Creating a form to enter data to the report. Accessing through mobile app.


===========================================================
Power Platform [It is the combination of the below 4 components]
============================================================
a) Power BI [Report / Dashboard Generation]
b) Power Apps [ quickly build and share low-code apps with Microsoft Power Apps.]
c) Power Automate [ Flow of tasks execution On-Demand, Scheduled, or Automate]
d) Power Virtual Agent [easily build intelligent chatbots, No coding required]

What is Power Automate?
Which will automate the operations. They run On-demand/ Scheduled /Automated.

What is Microsoft Flow?
Performing set of operations as a flow.
We can run the flow by manually triggering or scheduled way or automating

What is the difference between On-Demand, Schedule, and Automate?

On-Demand: User runs in their interested time / on the fly run / no specific time or event run
Schedule: Specific time run [daily refresh at 9 am]
Automate: Specific event run [ refresh when customer send an email] 


How do we access Microsoft Flow?
flow.microsoft.com

What is required to work with Microsoft flow?
Microsoft account is required

Real time examples:

a) Send en email, load data, after successful load send again an email, load data to cube database, send an email
b) You want to receive a mobile message as soon as you got an Important Indication email from my manager
c) SSIS Job--> DWH Job--> Dataset Refresh--> Report Generation [ MSBI and Power BI Combination]

Examples:

a) Send an email [gamil] before refresh of dataset, refresh dataset, send an email after refresh of dataset [will be discussed in the classroom]
 
Email--> Dataset Refresh--> Email



How many ways we refresh Dataset data?

1st way:

PBI Desktop level--> Manual refresh [refresh preview / refresh all]

2nd way:

PBI Service level--> On-Demand, Scheduled, Incremental

3rd way:
Microsoft Flow level--> On-Demand, Scheduled, and Automated


Example 2:

Refresh dataset data using Power BI Developer, REST API and Microsoft Flow
[Share you the video, use it]

=============================================================

Power Apps:

A low code approach to create mobile or tab apps and web based solutions.
Real-Time Scenario:
Delivery manager need a form in the app where he wants to see three buttons. 

When he clicks first button, respective report should sent to customer team.
When he clicks second button, respecive report should sent to sales managers.
When he clicks third button, respecive report should sent to subordinates.

Solution:
1st way:

We need .net / java / phython / html / php etc. languages code [ huge code approach].
We will create a form and implement button actions [more code required]

2nd way: [Simple Way]

Without this code we can create simple forms with actions using Power Apps [Low-Code approach].



Design Reason:

Now everyone can quickly build and share low-code apps with Microsoft Power Apps.

Ex: 
	Your customer wants to enter data and PBI report should show the same data?

	Solution:

	Create a mobile app [with simple form with set of text boxes and buttons], after entering details, when user clicks 	Submit, the data will be loaded to the database and report displayed with that data.
	
	Your customer need a form to enter data and below the form actual report.

	Solution:

	Create an app with two sections  

	a) Form section

	b) Report Display section [ Embed your Power BI Report]

	    ***Power Apps Power BI Embedding,
	    
Excercise today:
===============================================================
Example 1:

Sending an email to gmail using "Power Apps to Gmail "  in Power Automate [Microsoft Flow].
===============================================================

Example 2:

Click Power Apps button to send an email using "Gmail".  [Microsoft Flow]

===============================================================

Example 3:

Create an APP which shows Power BI report [ embedding report]

Embedding Power BI Report in PowerApps Canvas [in a tile]

https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=aeec1f28-c1e3-46d6-8254-de66884f6c41&autoAuth=true&ctid=e2aa1f92-8ae9-48c0-8aa8-894fb201ce24&config=eyJjbHVzdGVyVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93YWJpLWluZGlhLXdlc3QtcmVkaXJlY3QuYW5hbHlzaXMud2luZG93cy5uZXQvIn0%3D

Practice:

Power APPS App to show PBI Report

1. Make.powerapps.com, connect using MS Credentials
2. Create a blank form / select from gallery [ apperance suitable for mobile / tab]
3. Use the menu options / left pane options / right pane options to generate a form

The report which you want to embed, take the embed code of the report
[Power BI Service-->workspace-->report--> File menu-->embed-->Website / portal-->copy the first URL]

4. Save the App with proper name and description


After Power APPs APP Creation

1. Install Power APPs mobile app from play store
2. Connect using your credentials 
3. You will be able to see all the apps shared with you
4. You can now work on it


========================================================================================
Example 4:

Entering Details in a form and verifying the changes at source 

Practice:
a) Add one file at OneDrive [ if you use it, no Gateway connection required, if On-Premises sources used {SQL Server, C / D Drives} then Gateway connection is required.

b) Create an app form from one drive file

c) Do the changes fo formation (colors, fonts, titles, etc...) and styles, and Save it.

	a) Browser View
		See the options and change
	b) Detail view
		See the options and change
	c) Data View
		See the options and change

d) Go to preview, add rows, so that those rows will be visible at actual source at OneDrive.

e) Connect to Power APPs in the mobile, add rows / modify rows, those changes you will find in OneDrive file.

=======================================================================================


Example 5:
Create a Power BI Report from a data source, providing user an interface to enter / modify data, so that it will reflect in the source and
report level.


Power APP[ change data]---> OneDrive [Excel]---> Power BI Report in the Power BI Service refresh


b) Create a Power BI Report from the OneDrive Excel. This report will be refreshed when Power APPs level data changing.
a) Follow the above approach to take changes


Note:  You can Install a Gatewateway [Data Gateway], connect to On-Premise source and bring chanages to Power BI report from Mobile APP changes.
